# Bare metal hello world program for PAPER on Ariane

## This directory is a modified copy of the bootloader directory, where the bootloader was replaced with a bare-metal C program which operates PAPER.
The bare-metal C program src/main.c must be compiled and loaded into Ariane, for example using GDB.
